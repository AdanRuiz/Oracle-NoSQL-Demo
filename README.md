# Oracle NoSQL 1x3 Demo

**With this repository, it is possible to install Oracle NoSQL 1x3 in a single docker instance.**

## Requirements
1. Have installed Rancher Desktop (for Oracle Developers) or Docker (public).
2. Clone or download project files

## Instructions for Windows
### Install
1. Double click build_container.bat
2. Execute deploy_nosql.bat to install Oracle NoSQL
3. To stop just double click stop.bat

### Relaunch docker instance (After HOST machine restart)
1. Double click start.bat

### Reset Environment (Deletes image and container)
1. Double click delete_image_container.bat


Linux is supported, but I still dont have the automated commands feel free to parse bat files into sh files.
